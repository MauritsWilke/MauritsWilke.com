                <div class="title">Mister Apathy; Apathetic No More!: </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    Mr. Apathy would stroll down the wooded path of the Poplar Grove. He was a simple man. He had integrity. He loved the forest, he loved the animals, and he loved all the other nature around him. He cared for the forest, picking up any litter that he came across. He would display qualities of caring, diligence, and respect to the trees and plants around him. He would look up into the tree’s canopy and wonder to himself, “If only I could have responsibilities such as these trees, not a care in the world.” 
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    Mr. Apathy further showed great honesty and loyalty to the animals he would see. He would listen to the chipmunks’ chatter, the cooing of the doves, and the singing of the songbird. He would speak to the animals when he needed someone to talk to. He was honest with them. Speaking about his problems gave Mr. Apathy courage.

                <div class="paragraph">
                    Halfway through every journey of his, he would reach a creek. Given that the creek was generally flowing at a trickle, he had a tolerance for it. But at this time of the year, the creek had a tremendous flow. Many years back, an old tree had fallen across the river, so now there was a way to cross. Mr. Apathy wasn’t fully aware of the tree’s trustworthiness, but he would have to try crossing it anyway. The difficulty of this would remind him of his own challenges, but just like he could cross this river, he could face his obligations.

                <br>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    At the end of every journey, Mr. Apathy would come out feeling motivation and excitement. He could truly be fair to the world around him, and he was at peace.
